chatbot
A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity)
is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.
I will try to build a chatbot that can incorporate a railway reservation database to provide
simple but relevant responses while chatting. We need to successfully parse human
input and find the most relevant keywords with some understanding of the context. The availability
of chatbots 24/7 with the immense knowledge they can hold is all set to outperform humans. With
speed and accuracy, they are offering support to enterprises, they will soon augment human
capabilities. Users love to interact with chatbots as it saves them time and in most cases offers them
clear and concrete answers. They may not be perfect but they are scary close to be perfect.
